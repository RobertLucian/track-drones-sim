### npm start doesn't detect changes

* If the project runs inside a virtual machine such as (a Vagrant provisioned) VirtualBox, create an .env file in your project directory if it doesnâ€™t exist, and add `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` to it. This ensures that the next time you run npm start, the watcher uses the polling mode, as necessary inside a VM.
